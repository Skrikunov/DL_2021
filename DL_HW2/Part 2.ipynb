When grading, we will compute test accuracy by running your code that computes val accuracy, but having replaced the images in `'val/'` with the test set.\n","* *Submitting a neural net*:\n","  * **<font color=\"red\">Wrong checkpoint submission = zero points for accuracy.

Train a model, introduce one change, train again.\n","* Google a lot: try to reinvent as few wheels as possible (unlike in part 1 of this assignment). Harvest inspiration from PyTorch recipes, from GitHub, from blogs...\n","* Use GPU.\n","* Regularization is very important: L2, batch normalization, dropout, data augmentation...\n","* Pay much attention to accuracy and loss graphs (e.g. in TensorBoard). Track failures early, stop bad experiments early.\n","* 2-3 hours of training (in Colab) should be enough for most models, maybe 4-6 hours if you're experimenting.\n","* Save checkpoints every so often in case things go wrong (optimization diverges, Colab disconnects...).\n","* Don't use too large batches, they can be slow and memory-hungry. This is true for inference too.\n","* Also don't forget to use `torch.no_grad()` and `.eval()` during inference."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"m2qxvLGdFgGH"},"source":["# Determine the locations of auxiliary libraries and datasets.\n","# `AUX_DATA_ROOT` is where 'notmnist.py', 'animation.py' and 'tiny-imagenet-2020.zip' are.\n","\n","# Detect if we are in Google Colaboratory\n","try:\n","    import google.colab\n","    IN_COLAB = True\n","except ImportError:\n","    IN_COLAB = False\n","\n","from pathlib import Path\n","if IN_COLAB:\n","    google.colab.drive.mount(\"/content/drive\")\n","    \n","    # Change this if you created the shortcut in a different location\n","    AUX_DATA_ROOT = Path(\"/content/drive/My Drive/Deep Learning 2021 -- Home Assignment 2\")\n","    \n","    assert AUX_DATA_ROOT.is_dir(), \"Have you forgot to 'Add a shortcut to Drive'?\"\n","    \n","    import sys\n","    sys.path.append(str(AUX_DATA_ROOT))\n","else:\n","    AUX_DATA_ROOT = Path(\".\")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"TcFGHHXVsM-J"},"source":["# Imports\n","\n","# Your solution\n","%load_ext autoreload\n","%autoreload 1\n","\n","%aimport part2_solution"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"X5eKWQv9wi3P"},"source":["# If `True`, will train the model from scratch and validate it.\n","# If `False`, instead of training will load weights from './checkpoint.pth'.\n","# When grading, we will test both cases.\n","DO_TRAIN = True"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"njk50aDoFgGT"},"source":["# Put training and validation images in `./tiny-imagenet-200/train` and `./tiny-imagenet-200/val`:\n","if not Path(\"tiny-imagenet-200/train/class_000/00000.jpg\").is_file():\n","    import zipfile\n","    with zipfile.ZipFile(AUX_DATA_ROOT / 'tiny-imagenet-2020.zip', 'r') as archive:\n","        archive.extractall()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AFqnb1-EFgGj"},"source":["# Initialize dataloaders\n","train_dataloader = part2_solution.get_dataloader(\"./tiny-imagenet-200/\", 'train')\n","val_dataloader   = part2_solution.get_dataloader(\"./tiny-imagenet-200/\", 'val')\n","\n","# Initialize the raw model\n","model = part2_solution.get_model()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"J9n7DyGcFgGq"},"source":["if DO_TRAIN:\n","    # Train from scratch\n","    optimizer = part2_solution.get_optimizer(model)\n","    part2_solution.train_on_tinyimagenet(train_dataloader, val_dataloader, model, optimizer)\n","else:\n","    # Download the checkpoint and initialize model weights from it\n","    import urllib\n","    import subprocess\n","\n","    penalize = False\n","\n","    # Get your link and checksum\n","    claimed_md5_checksum, google_drive_link = part2_solution.get_checkpoint_metadata()\n","\n","    # Use your link to download \"checkpoint.pth\"\n","    !gdown --id {urllib.parse.urlparse(google_drive_link).path.split('/')[-2]}\n","\n","    try:\n","        # Compute the actual checksum\n","        real_md5_checksum = subprocess.check_output(\n","            [\"md5sum\", \"checkpoint.pth\"]).decode().split()[0]\n","    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as err:\n","        # Couldn't download or the filename isn't \"checkpoint.pth\"\n","        print(f\"Wrong link or filename: {err}\")\n","        penalize = True\n","    else:\n","        # The trained checkpoint is different from the one submitted\n","        if real_md5_checksum != claimed_md5_checksum:\n","            print(\"Checksums differ!
